# Alley's Reveal.js Template

This template is ready for Alley team members to start writing presenations in HTML or Markdown.

Fork this repo, add your content to index.html, make any style adjustments to `css/theme/source/alley.scss` (then `npm run build`), and away you go!

The template comes with both a red and black background. Check out `images/` to see each. To use black, you'll want to change `alley.scss` to set a different `$backgroundColor` and possibly uncomment `bodyBackground()`.
